        <li>1 ½ tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>½ medium onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 medium tomato, chopped</li>
        <li>1 small green chile pepper</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon ginger paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garam masala</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon dried mint</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 ½ sprigs cilantro</li>
        <li>½ (3 pound) whole chicken, skin removed and cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 quart water</li>
        <li>2 cups uncooked basmati rice</li>
        <li>½ cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>½ bay leaf</li>
        <li>2 pods green cardamom</li>
        <li>½ pod black cardamom</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon powdered yellow food coloring</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in yogurt and vinegar. Add onion; cook and stir until golden and tender. Add tomatoes, chile peppers, garlic, and ginger paste. Cook and stir until tomatoes are tender. Season with garam masala, mint, salt, and pepper. Stir in cilantro.</li>
        <li>Place chicken into tomato-onion mixture in the skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring water and rice to a boil in a large pot. Mix in cinnamon stick, bay leaf, green cardamom, and black cardamom. Season with salt. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until rice is tender and water is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Discard whole spices.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/2 of the cooked rice in the bottom of a large serving dish. Pour chicken mixture on top. Cover with remaining cooked rice. Sprinkle with food coloring; mix to serve.</li>
